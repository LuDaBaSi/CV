  <h2 align="center"> About </h2>

<p style="text-align: center;"> Throughout my career, I've been working on different approaches to data.</p> 
<p style="text-align: center;"> First, I started working with a lot of economic data; supply and demand in real life. A few months in, I realized how the data impacted the logistics department and ultimately production. However, after my analysis, information was still pouring in. This required further investigation and is how I got introduced to the exciting world of business intelligence.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> I began creating reports with few variables, it didn't take long to understand that a business is full of different connections and dependencies. The more variables I added to my models, the more insights I could take from them.<p /> By the time I left this job, I was connecting variables from economic data with the revenue and logistics department. I was also a certified Financial Modeling and Data Analyst (FMVA) by the Corporate Finance Institute.</p> 
<p style="text-align: center"> Despite learning the basics of BI, I didn't have the opportunity to work with financial data. I got that chance at my next position. This time I was working for a global company with ERP, CRM, and ETL tools. In a few months, I was reporting on P&L statements with data from revenue, marketing, and the general economic environment. Not only that, but I was responsible for the launch of a brand-new E-Com platform that allowed me to connect revenue with logistics.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> As a result of my work, our company had high-level reports on marketing, revenue, and finance. Additionally, I managed the new E-Com platform, setting targets and designing online campaigns.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> Today, my current role is even more data-driven. I am the proud BI tool admin, which requires me to direct our entire data flow for marketing, revenue, and finance.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> My success as a BI Manager is a result of my skills in SSRS (from my Business Intelligence and Data Analyst certification), and my fundamental knowledge of SSIS (from my on-the-job training).<p />Apart from this, I started a personal project on financial literacy, where I currently spend most of my free time.</p>
